KeySAV 2.0

3DS X/Y/OR/AS SaveFile Box / Battle Video PKX cracking program.

KeySAV is a tool that can decrypt portions of encrypted Generation 6 Pokemon saves, including X, Y, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire.

With this tool you can view IVs/Nature/ESV/TSV and much more of Hatched/Unhatched Pok√©mon that are in your boxes or battle videos, as long as you follow the setup guide properly.

SUPPORTS BOTH RETAIL CARTRIDGES AND DIGITAL COPIES

If you have a digital copy, you only need an SD card reader to extract your encrypted save.

If you have a retail copy, you need additional hardware to extract your encrypted save from your cartridge, such as the Datel Action Replay PowerSaves 3DS.

CyberGadget encrypted save backups are also supported.
